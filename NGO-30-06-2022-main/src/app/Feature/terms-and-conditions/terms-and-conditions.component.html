  While we try our best to do so, we cannot and do not verify 100% of the information that Campaigners supply. We try our best to see that Donations are used in accordance with the stated fundraising purpose; we also collect documents before disbursing Donations to the Campaigner in many cases. However, please understand that we cannot guarantee that 100% of the time Donations will be used in accordance with any fundraising purpose prescribed by a Campaigner or Charity. We assume no responsibility to verify whether the Donations are used in accordance with any applicable laws, and such responsibility rests solely with the Campaigner or Charity, as applicable. While we have no legal obligation to verify that the use of any funds raised is in accordance with applicable law and these Terms of Service, we try to do the verifications for many campaigns and more important we take possible fraudulent activity and the misuse of funds raised very seriously.

<p>Dispute Resolution By Binding Arbitration: PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS</p>
<p>Most user concerns can be resolved quickly and to the user's satisfaction by emailing Crowd Works India Foundation support at info@CrowdWorksIndia.org In the unlikely event that our user support team is unable to resolve a complaint you may have (or if Crowd Works India Foundation has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with you after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration, mediation, or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Also, in any arbitration under this arbitration provision in which you seek less than Rs. 50,000 in damages, Crowd Works India Foundation will pay reasonable attorneys' fees should you prevail. Crowd Works India Foundation will not seek attorneys' fees from you. However, if you initiate an arbitration in which you seek more than Rs. 50,000 in damages, the payment of attorneys' fees will be governed by the applicable rules (as defined below). Any arbitration under this Agreement will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted.</p>

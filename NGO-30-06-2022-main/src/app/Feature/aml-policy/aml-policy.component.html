<h6><u>I. SCOPE AND APPLICABILITY</u></h6>

Crowd Works India Foundation’s ability to comply with its obligations under applicable law is dependent on your cooperation and we seek your cooperation via this policy.</p>
<p>2. To ensure that we are not involved in any transactions that are known or suspected to be means of laundering money if any suspicious activity is noticed, users of the Crowd Works India Foundation platform are urged to promptly contact government authorities to facilitate any action that may be needed.</p>

Terrorist organisations, tax evaders, smugglers, persons involved in bribery or any persons that receive money for illegal activities and/or through illegal means may launder money.</p>
<p>2. Recognising transactions involving money laundering requires awareness of possible suspicious activity, which may arise at any time. Below is an indicative list of actions that persons associated with Crowd Works India Foundation should be careful of. This list is not exhaustive, as every circumstance is not foreseeable.
